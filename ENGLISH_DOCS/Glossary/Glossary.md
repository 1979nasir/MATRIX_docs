# Glossary

## Address	
Account credentials on MATRIX network are given by a key pair, which consists of a private key and a public key, the latter being derived from the former through an algorithm. The public key is usually used for session key encryption, signature verification and encrypting data that could be decrypted by a corresponding private key.
## Application Layer	
Developers are able to utilize interfaces for the realization of diverse DApps and customized wallets.  
## Asset	
In MATRIX documents, asset is the same as token.
## Balance (MAN)
A MAN account shows the balance of MAN and other tokens as well as their USD equivalent.
## Block	
Blocks contains the digital records of your transactions. A complete block consists of the magic number, block size, blockheader, transaction counter and transactions. 
## Blockheader	
A blockheader is part of a block. It contains the hash of the previous block, the Merkle root, the timestamp, the difficulty and the nonce.
## Cold Wallet	
Cold wallet, also known as offline wallet, keeps the private key completely disconnected from any network. Cold wallets are usually installed on "cold" devices (computers or mobile phones staying offline) to ensure the security of MATRIX private key. Private keys are kept away from the network by utilizing QR codes for payment.
## Hot Wallet	
Hot wallet, also known as online wallet, allows user's private key to be used while online, thus it could be susceptible to potential vulnerabilities or interception by malicious actors.
## Consensus	
The consensus mechanism verifies and confirms transactions very swiftly. In such a dynamically changing status of the blockchain, these publicly shared ledgers need an efficient, fair, real-time, functional, reliable, and secure mechanism to ensure that all the transactions occurring on the network are genuine and all participants agree on a consensus on the status of the ledger. This all important task is performed by the consensus mechanism, which is a set of rules that decides on the contributions by the various participants of the blockchain.
## DApp
Decentralized application, Service that operates without a central trusted party. An application that enables direct interaction/agreements/communication between end users and/or resources without a middleman.	
## Private Testnet
Private testnet: developers configure their ID and server IP according to MATRIX deployment configuration file to participate in testing. 
## RPC 
Remote Procedure Call
## Scalability	
Scalability is a feature of the MATRIX Protocol. It is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.	
## Throughput
High throughput is a feature of MATRIX. It is also known as TPS, namely the maximum transaction capacity in a second.
## Timestamp	
The approximate of block production time is recorded as Unix timestamp, which is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC (1 Jan 1970).
## Transaction	
Transaction refers to the process of token transfer between different accounts.
## Transaction Broadcasting	
Transaction information is verified by nodes and broadcasted in the blockchain network.
